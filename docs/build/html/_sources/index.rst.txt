Privkit: A Privacy Toolkit
===================================

Privkit is a privacy toolkit that provides methods for privacy analysis. It includes different data types, privacy-preserving mechanisms, attacks, and metrics. The current version is focused on location data and facial data. The Python Package is designed in a modular manner and can be easily extended to include new mechanisms. Privkit can be used to process data, configure privacy-preserving mechanisms, apply attacks, and also evaluate the privacy/utility trade-off through suitable metrics.

.. warning::
  privkit is an ongoing open-source framework. If you find errors or if you have suggestions, please open an issue in the repository. We would love to hear from you!
